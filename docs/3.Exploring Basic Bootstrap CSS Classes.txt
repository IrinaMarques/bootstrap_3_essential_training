3.1 Styling headings and body copy 
===================================

--> lesson_3_1.html

Bootstrap uses Helvetica Neue if available and then tries to look for Helvetica, Arial and if nothing else it's a available  it uses the default CSS sans-serif font.

<h1> to <h6>
We can use for the same size and same font as the headline:
<h1>Something</h1>
<div class='h1'>Something</div1>
<span class='h1'>Something</span> - In a middle of a phrase

<small> tag
We can also create secondary text inside a headline or inside body copy using the samll tag.
We can also have a small class to use within the inline elements.

Within body copy the global defont size is 14 pixels with a line height of about 1.428.

Paragraphs also gets a bottom margin, 10 pixels by default. 

.lead style
Makes the text stands out a litle bit from the rest of the text.
