6.1 Creating a dropdown
========================

1.
Wrap both the button and the list with a DIV that has a class of dropdown.
<div class='dropdown'>

2.
Add the data toggle equals dropdown attribute to the button.
<button type='button' data-toggle='dropdown' class='btn btn-info'>Pet Type</button>

3.
Add a class of dropdown toggle.
<button type='button' data-toggle='dropdown' class='btn btn-info dropdown-toggle'>Pet Type</button>

4.
On the unordered list add the dropdown menu class. 
<ul class='dropdown-menu'>

5.
Add a caret to let the user know that this button is going to behave differently than a regular button. 

6.
Add an id so can be linked to the dropdown.
On the button id='pettype'
On the ul aria-label='pettype'

7.
Ass another elements to the button - accessibility:
aria-haspopup='true' - let screen readers know that this element has a popup.
aria-expanded='true' - let screen readers know that this element has an expandable or collapsible region. 

8.
Create a dropdown header:
.dropdown-header
<li class='dropdown-header'>Common</li>

9.
Add a divider:
.divider
<li role='separator' class='divider'></li>

10.
Add a disable class to an element
.disabled

11.
Use a button group to create a split button. Allow to combine buttons together.
.btn-goup

========================
6.2 Using button groups
========================

Creating groups:

1.
Add a div with a class of btn-group with a role of group.
.btn-group
<div class='btn-group' role='group'>

Add a label so reader know what to say
aria-label='...'

2.
We can make the buttons vertically instead of horizontally
.btn-group-vertical

3.
We can also combine as a toolbar - marked as being related.
So we have to create a div with a class of btn-toolbar
.btn-toolbar

4.
justify button groups - expand to be the full width of is container
.btn-group-justified

Each button as to be on it own group

=============================================
6.3 Understanding the Bootstrap nav component
=============================================

Three diferent types of nav that we can create:
- tabs
- pills
- navbars

<ul class='nav nav-tabs/pills/navbar'>

Usability role='presentation'

1.
To a tab:
.nav-tabs

To pills:
.nav-pills

2.
We can stack:
.nav-stack

3.
Pills can also be justified:
.nav-pills .nav-justified

4.
The navbar is just a special type of navigation that has a navbar-nav class. Look more like navigation.
.navbar-nav

- Navigation doesn't usually go inside a container 
- Can make fit the entire width of the container
- At the mobile break point, which is xs, or 768 pixels, the navbars will become stacked

To make this more accessible we need to create a nav element that wraps around the navbar.

There are other classes that we can use in the navbar-nav
.navbar-default
.navbar-inverse
.navbar-fixed-buttom
.navbar-fixed-top

A normal navigation takes about 50px.

=================================
6.4 Adding content to the navbar
=================================

We can put any number of elements inside the navbar but to align them properly we have to wrapthem in special classes. 

1.
Navbar-header
The navbar-header
.navbar-brand - special class for create the brand, can be text or icon. Usually the band is linked to the homepage.
.navbar-text

<div class='navbar-header'>
<a href="#" class='navbar-brand'>Wisdom Pets</a>
<p class='navbar-text'>pet loving care</p>
</div>

We can add a button but it needs an additional class
.navbar-btn

A navbar forms
.navbar-form

One of the problems with a lot of form elements, is that they won't align properly once they reach a certain size - for that dropdowns are a solution.

===============================
6.5 Collapsing your navigation
===============================

When you view a navigation component on an access breakpoint, that means a breakpoint that is smaller than 768 pixels, the navigation is going to stack up on top of one another like this. It's common to display something called a Hamburger menu that expands to display the complete list.

1.
Group the navigation
<div class='collapse navbar-collapse' id='collapse-menu'>
