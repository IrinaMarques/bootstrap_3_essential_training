Wrap both the button and the list with a DIV that has a class of dropdown.
<div class='dropdown'>

2.
Add the data toggle equals dropdown attribute to the button.
<button type='button' data-toggle='dropdown' class='btn btn-info'>Pet Type</button>

3.
Add a class of dropdown toggle.
<button type='button' data-toggle='dropdown' class='btn btn-info dropdown-toggle'>Pet Type</button>

4.
On the unordered list add the dropdown menu class. 
<ul class='dropdown-menu'>

5.
Add a caret to let the user know that this button is going to behave differently than a regular button. 

6.
Add an id so can be linked to the dropdown.
On the button id='pettype'
On the ul aria-label='pettype'

7.
Ass another elements to the button - accessibility:
aria-haspopup='true' - let screen readers know that this element has a popup.
aria-expanded='true' - let screen readers know that this element has an expandable or collapsible region. 

8.
Create a dropdown header:
.dropdown-header
<li class='dropdown-header'>Common</li>

9.
Add a divider:
.divider
<li role='separator' class='divider'></li>

10.
Add a disable class to an element
.disabled

11.
Use a button group to create a split button. Allow to combine buttons together.
.btn-goup

========================
6.2 Using button groups
========================

Creating groups:

1.
Add a div with a class of btn-group with a role of group.
.btn-group
<div class='btn-group' role='group'>

Add a label so reader know what to say
aria-label='...'

2.
We can make the buttons vertically instead of horizontally
.btn-group-vertical

3.
We can also combine as a toolbar - marked as being related.
So we have to create a div with a class of btn-toolbar
.btn-toolbar

4.
justify button groups - expand to be the full width of is container
.btn-group-justified

Each button as to be on it own group
