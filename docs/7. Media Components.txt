======================

Labels and badges are two useful CSS components that can take care of instances where you want to pass certain bits of information to the user. 

Labels
- the size is contextual depending the parent
.label + .label-color (danger, warning, default, info, primary, success)
<h2>Label <span class='label label-danger'>new</h2>

Badge
- indicate that maybe there's a number of articles.
- only have this grey color.
.badge
<a href="#">read articles <span class='badge'>4</span></a>
