========================
8.1 Styling list groups
========================

Add a class
.list-group
<ul class='list-group'>

Each list items another class
.list-group-item
<li class='list-group-item'>Sydney Bastlett</li>

We can create a badge
.badge
<li class='list-group-item'>Cally Reynolds<span class='badge'>14</span></li>

If we use a div instead of a ul and a a instead li we make links to the names. To be clicable don't need to use button styles.

There are another classes that we can use to make the text smaller.
.active
.disable
.list-group-item-success (info, danger, warnning, default..) 

========================
8.2 Working with panels
========================

Panels are similar to what you can do with thumbnails and even list groups, but they have a different structure a little more semantic sense.

Can combine these with tables and list groups to create slightly more complex layouts than you can do with something like a thumbnail.

Create a div with a class
.panel
.panel-default
.panel-primary
.panel-seccess
.panel-info
.panel-warnning
.panel-danger

Inside the panel we can have
.panel-heading
.panel-body

For the headline
.panel-title

Add other things
- table --> https://goo.gl/V8pFxr
- list group

.well

Amout of indentation.
.well-lg
.well-sm
