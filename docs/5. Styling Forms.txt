=========================
5.1 Creating a basic form
=========================

A label for='' have a corresponding input id=''

<label for='inputName'>Name</label>
<input type="text" id="inputName" placeholder="Name">

.sr-only - hide the labels that we don't want and they appear in small screens only.
.form-control - the field gets a little padding and color when is selected. And it's 100% of the width of the container.
.form-group - add space between the groups. Have to create a <div> with this class.

Checkboxes are a special case.

===========================================
5.2 Formatting radio and checkbox controls
===========================================

When we do checkboxes or radio boxes we add a div with a class of checkbox.
<div class='checkbox'>
The labels are wrapped around the control instead of traditionally placed next to the controls and don't have a for attribute.

Use checkboxes when we want the user to be able to choose one or more options.

In the radio option if we give the same name='' to the options the user only can choose one of the options. 

We also have the disabled option.
Ex. 
<input name='options' type="radio" disabled>

We can also run checkboxes or radio buttons as a series of inline element. But to do that we have to take the div with the class of radio. 

====================== 
5.3 Using inline forms
======================

Styles that will apply to Sm breakpoint or bigger than 768px.
We have to add the class
.form-inline 

Hide the labels.
When we wnat to hide a lable we should use the class of sr-only

To center the form:
We go to the css and make a text-align: center

============================= 
5.4 Styling a horizontal form
=============================

The classes uses the Bootstrap grid System.
It's not going to work on a view that is smaller than 768px.

Using the column system to make the horizontal form. In the:
- labels
- ckeckbox
- submit button

============================ 
5.5 Using validation styles
============================

Styles related to validation:
.has-warning - yellow border
.has-error - red border
.has-success - green border
.control-label - get the same color as the input field

Add icons to the validation for visual feedback about the forms.
.has-feedback
div class='form-group has-success has-feedback'>
And add a span with a class of glyphicon
<span class='glyphicon glyphicon-ok form-control-feedback' aria-hidden='true'>
